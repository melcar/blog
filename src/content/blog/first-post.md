First entry in my blog. In here I will post about the projects I am working on, what I find interesting in them and the issues I face and how I solved them.

Recently I started a project with the goal of implementing compression algorithms. I started this project in Rust, a language I am new at. So far it has been a delightfull experience, on the Rust side as well as on the compression side!

See you soon for a new entry!

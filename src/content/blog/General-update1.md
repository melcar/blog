This is the second article of this blog and already a few weeks have passed by. I have been pretty busy and I have not found time or motivation to sit down and do some of the bigger changes I am planning on doing.

Since the 17th of March, I have done some minor refactoring of the [CMPRSD](https://cmprsd.beltus.be) code base. And I have also spent some time on [root me](https://www.root-me.org/melcar) where I completed a few cryptanalysis challenges and steganography. It has been nice to dive back into this area and I am looking forward to doing more of those from time to time. It allows me to explore new tools such as [hashcat](https://hashcat.net/hashcat/) and [john the ripper](https://www.openwall.com/john/) and learn what [rockyou.txt](https://www.keepersecurity.com/blog/2023/08/04/understanding-rockyou-txt-a-tool-for-security-and-a-weapon-for-hackers/) is. Or even writing small scripts to solve challenges. It has been comforting to be able to just sit down and do something completely different than what I am used to when it comes to computer science.

Finally today I updated the blog by adding a tag system. It is now possible to filter blog posts by clicking on a tag button. I know, great feature for Filtering a two-post blog. But soon more articles will come. First I will write about what [CMPRSD](https://cmprsd.beltus.be) is, what is the end goal and the next steps. I will also write updates if I learn anything interesting while doing some root me. And finally, some new side projects will be started, giving me a wide range of projects to choose from when I find time to code.

Next step: Writing more doc for [CMPRSD](https://cmprsd.beltus.be) and publishing the rust documentation on [cmprsd.beltus.be](https://cmprsd.beltus.be).
